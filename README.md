# Hi there, Greeting from Yuangga ðŸ‘‹
## About me:
- Hi, Iâ€™m Yuangga. Since early 2024, I've been pursuing a career as a QA/Software Tester, and I'm thrilled to have found a field where I can truly excel. In my previous role, I was involved in User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for core banking system upgrades as System Owner Feature Tester, which deepened my appreciation for functionality and accessibility in software.
- As a QA professional, I'm passionate about making the digital world more user-friendly for everyone. In this portfolio, I aim to share my QA knowledge and demonstrate the practical skills I've developed through courses, self-study, and hands-on experience.
- I am committed to continuous growth in this field and have recently begun studying test automation, focusing on Java Selenium. My current goal is to enhance my knowledge (and elevate skills) in this area.
